 - Fixes "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.xerial.snappy.SnappyOutputStream" issue (#50)

## 3.0.0.beta2
 - Added SSL/TLS connection support to Kafka
 - Breaking: Changed default codec to plain instead of SSL. Json codec is really slow when used 
   with inputs because inputs by default are single threaded. This makes it a bad
   first user experience. Plain codec is a much better default.

 - Fix safe shutdown while plugin waits on Kafka for new events
 - Expose auto_commit_interval_ms to control offset commit frequency

## 2.0.3
 - Fix infinite loop when no new messages are found in Kafka

## 2.0.0
 - Plugins were updated to follow the new shutdown semantic, this mainly allows Logstash to instruct input plugins to terminate gracefully, 
   instead of using Thread.raise on the plugins' threads. Ref: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/3895
 - Dependency on logstash-core update to 2.0
