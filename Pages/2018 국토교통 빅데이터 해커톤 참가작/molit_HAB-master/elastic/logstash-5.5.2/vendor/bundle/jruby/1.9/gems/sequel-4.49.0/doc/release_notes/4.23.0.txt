= New Features

* An update_refresh plugin has been added, for refreshing a model
  instance when updating.  The default behavior is to only refresh
  when inserting.  However, if you have triggers on the model's table,
  it's a good idea to refresh when updating to pick up the possibly
  changed values.  On databases that support UPDATE RETURNING, such as
  PostgreSQL, the update and refresh are done in a single query.

* A delay_add_association plugin has been added, for delaying add_*
  method calls for associations until after the receiver has been
  saved, if the receiver is a new object. Example:

    artist = Artist.new(:name=>'Foo')
    artist.add_album(Album.new(:name=>'Bar'))
    # No database queries yet

    artist.save # Saves artist, then album

* A validate_associated plugin has been added, for validating
  associated objects when validating the current object.  This
  was extracted from the nested_attributes plugin, and is also
  used by the delay_add_association plugin.  For example,
  if you have an albums association and you want to validate all
  associated objects before saving the current object, you can
  cal validate_associated_object for each object:

    def validate
      super
      reflection = association_reflection(:albums)
      associations[:albums].each do |obj|
        validate_associated_object(reflection, obj)
      end
    end

= Other Improvements

* Database#transaction now returns the block return value if
  :rollback=>:always is used.  Previously, it would return nil in
  that case.

* Postgres::JSONBOp#[] and #get_text now return JSONBOp instances
  instead of JSONOp instances.

* Model#move_to, #move_up, and #move_down in the list plugin now
  automatically handle out-of-range targets by defaulting to the first
  or last position in the list.  Previously, using an out of range
  target would raise an exception.

* Database#add_named_conversion_proc on PostgreSQL now works for enum
  types.

* dataset.call_sproc(:insert, ...) now works correctly on JDBC.

* postgresql:// connection strings are now supported, since that is
  the protocol name supported by libpq.

* Sequel has switched from rspec to minitest/spec for testing, and
  now uses random test order when testing. During the conversion
  process, many test order dependency bugs were fixed.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The deprecated fdbsql, jdbc/fdbsql, and openbase adapters have been
  removed.
