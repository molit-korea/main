## 3.3.0
 - Add top level user/password options that apply to all URLs by default.
 - Make user/password configurable per-URL nested at the top level without the extra auth hash
   to make them more consistent with the global opts
 - Bump mixin-http_client version

## 3.2.0
 - Use eager auth. This means the client will send any credentials in its first request
   rather than waiting for a 401 challenge

## 3.1.1
 - Handle empty bodies correctly
## 3.1.0
 - Use rufus-scheduler for more flexible scheduling. Many thanks to [@hummingV](https://github.com/hummingV) for this contribution. ([#58](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-http_poller/pull/58))

## 3.0.3
  - Require logstash-mixin-http_client 4.0.3 which fixes error messaging around key/trust-stores when no password supplied

## 3.0.1
  - Republish all the gems under jruby.

## 2.0.5
  - Depend on logstash-core-plugin-api instead of logstash-core, removing the need to mass update plugins on major releases of logstash

## 2.0.4
  - New dependency requirements for logstash-core for the 5.0 release

## 2.0.2
 - Bump http_client mixin to use better stale check for keepalives

## 2.0.1

## 2.0.0
 - Plugins were updated to follow the new shutdown semantic, this mainly allows Logstash to instruct input plugins to terminate gracefully,
   instead of using Thread.raise on the plugins' threads. Ref: https://github.com/elastic/logstash/pull/3895
