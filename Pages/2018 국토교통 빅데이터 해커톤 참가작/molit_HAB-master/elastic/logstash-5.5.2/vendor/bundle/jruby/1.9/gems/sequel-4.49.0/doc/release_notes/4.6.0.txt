= New Features

* Database#call_mssql_sproc is now available for calling
  stored procedures on Microsoft SQL Server, including the use
  of output parameters.

* The Database#{commit,rollback}_prepared_transaction methods now
  support a :server option for the server on which to operate.

= Other Improvements

* On Microsoft SQL Server 2012, the native OFFSET/FETCH support
  is now used for offsets, instead of emulating support via the
  ROW_NUMBER window function.

* Eager loading is now skipped when doing eager(...).naked.all on
  a model dataset, instead of raising an error.  This can fix issues
  when the eager_each plugin is used.

* A couple additional disconnection errors are now detected in the
  jdbc/postgresql adapter.

* The tinytds adapter now handles returning rows when the fields
  are not immediately available.

* RuntimeErrors raised by oci8 are now handled correctly in the
  oracle adapter.

* Sequel's specs now work with RSpec 3, while still running
  correctly on RSpec 1.3 and 2.
