= New Features

* fdbsql and jdbc/fdbsql adapters have been added, for connecting to
  FoundationDB SQL Layer.

* A split_values plugin has been added, for moving non-column entries
  from the values hash into a separate hash.  This allows you to
  select additional columns (e.g. computed columns) when retrieving
  model instances, and be able to save those instances without
  removing the additional columns.

* A Sequel::Model.cache_associations accessor has been added, which
  can be set to false to not cache any association metadata.  This
  can fix issues in a development environment that uses code
  reloading.

* The active_model plugin now supports activemodel 4.2.0beta1.

* More PostgreSQL array types are handled automatically by the
  pg_array extension, such as xml[] and uuid[].

* Creating foreign tables is now supported on PostgreSQL via the
  :foreign and :options create_table options.

* The :nolog Database option is now supported in the informix
  adapter, where it disables the use of transactions.

* PlaceholderLiteralizer#with_dataset has been added, allowing you
  to create another PlaceholderLiteralizer with a modified dataset,
  useful if you want to change the row_proc or any non-SQL dataset
  options.

= Other Improvements

* The tactical_eager_loading plugin once again works correctly with
  limited associations.

* A bug in older versions of MySQL is now worked around when schema
  dumping a table with multiple timestamp columns.

* On PostgreSQL, create_view(:view_name, dataset, :materialized=>true)
  is now reversible.

* Postgres::{JSON,JSONB}Op#to_record and #to_recordset no longer take
  an optional argument.  This was supported in PostgreSQL 9.4beta1,
  but removed before PostgreSQL 9.4beta2.

* Dataset#insert now returns the last inserted id in the informix
  adapter.

* Sequel no longer raises an exception in
  AssociationReflection#reciprocal if the associated class has an
  association that does not have a valid associated class.

* Sequel now raises an exception if a primary key is necessary to use
  an association, but the model does not have a primary key.
