    # The delay_add_association plugin delays the adding of
    # associated objects to a new (unsaved) object until after the new
    # object is saved.  By default, if you attempt to add
    # associated objects to a new object, Sequel will raise
    # an error, because you need to have a primary key before
    # saving the objects.
    #
    # When delaying the add of an associated object, the object
    # will be immediately added to the cached association array.
    # When saving the current object, it will also attempt to
    # validate any associated objects, and if the associated objects
    # are not valid, the current object will also be considered
    # not valid.
    #
    # Usage:
    #
    #   # Make all model subclass delay add_association for new objects
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin :delay_add_association
    #
    #   # Make the Album class delay add_association for new objects
    #   Album.plugin :delay_add_association
    module DelayAddAssociation
      # Depend on the validate_associated plugin.

        mod.plugin :validate_associated
