    # The Subclasses plugin keeps track of all subclasses of the
    # current model class.  Direct subclasses are available via the
    # subclasses method, and all descendent classes are available via the
    # descendents method:
    #
    #   c = Class.new(Sequel::Model)
    #   c.plugin :subclasses
    #   sc1 = Class.new(c)
    #   sc2 = Class.new(c)
    #   ssc1 = Class.new(sc1)
    #   c.subclasses    # [sc1, sc2]
    #   sc1.subclasses  # [ssc1]
    #   sc2.subclasses  # []
    #   ssc1.subclasses # []
    #   c.descendents   # [sc1, ssc1, sc2]
    #
    # You can also finalize the associations and then freeze the classes
    # in all descendent classes.  Doing so is a recommended practice after
    # all models have been defined in production and testing, and this makes
    # it easier that keeping track of the classes to finalize and freeze
    # manually:
    #
    #   c.freeze_descendants
    #
    # You can provide a block when loading the plugin, and it will be called
    # with each subclass created:
    #
    #   a = []
    #   Sequel::Model.plugin(:subclasses){|sc| a << sc}
    #   class A < Sequel::Model; end
    #   class B < Sequel::Model; end
    #   a # => [A, B]
