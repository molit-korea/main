= Deprecated Features

* Setting an invalid dataset for a model is now deprecated.
  Historically, Sequel has swallowed exceptions for this to keep
  backwards compatibility, but it generally just results in code
  breaking later.  To allow invalid datasets to be used:

    Sequel::Model.require_valid_table = false

* The association_autoreloading and many_to_one_pk_lookup plugins
  are now deprecated.  They were moved from plugins to standard
  model behavior in Sequel 4.0, and have been no-ops since.

* The pg_typecast_on_load plugin is now deprecated.  It is only useful
  on the already deprecated do and swift adapters.

= New Features

* Database#with_server in the server_block extension now accepts an
  optional second argument for the read only server to use.  This
  allows for overriding the default server while providing a separate
  default for read only queries:

    DB.with_server(:server1, :server1ro) do
      DB[:a].all       # Uses server1ro
      DB[:b].insert(1) # Uses server1
    end

* Model.default_association_type_options has been added, allowing the
  ability to set default options per association type.  This can be
  used to make some association types read_only by default:

    opts = Sequel::Model.default_association_type_options
    opts[:one_to_many] = opts[:many_to_many] = {:read_only=>true}
  
* Database#views on PostgreSQL now accepts a :materialized option to
  return materialized views instead of regular views.

= Other Improvements

* Setting Sequel::Model.require_valid_table = true no longer raises
  an exception when using a valid dataset that selects from a subquery
  or table returning function or uses a join.

* The defaults_setter plugin now inherits any custom default
  values when subclassing.

* The schema_dumper extension now handles Oracle 11g XE behavior of
  appending not null to the database type.

= Backwards Compatibility

* External callers of Database#check_non_connection_error (private
  method) should update their code to call it with a true or false
  argument specifying whether to raise an error for exceptions that
  are not connection errors.
