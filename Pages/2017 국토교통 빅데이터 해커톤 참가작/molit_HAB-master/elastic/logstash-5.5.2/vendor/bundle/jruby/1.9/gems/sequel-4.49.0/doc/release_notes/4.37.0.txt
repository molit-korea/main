= New Features

* Database#values has been added on SQLite#3.8.3+, operating similarly
  to the support on PostgreSQL:

    DB.values([[1, 2], [3, 4]]).select_map([:column1, :column2])
    # => [[1, 2], [3, 4]]

* Regular expressions in dataset filters are now supported on Oracle
  10g+:

    DB[:t].where(:c=>/re/)
    # SELECT * FROM "T" WHERE REGEXP_LIKE("C",'re')

= Other Improvements

* Sequel now supports the use of native prepared statements and bound
  variables in the mysql2 adapter, when mysql2 0.4+ is used.
  Previously, the mysql2 adapter supported database prepared
  statements, but variables were always literalized.  That is still
  supported when mysql2 <0.4 is used.

* The connection pool now removes connections if it detects a
  disconnect error that is not raised as a
  Sequel::DatabaseDisconnectError.  Such exceptions are reraised
  without converted them to Sequel::DatabaseDisconnectError, but the
  related connection is now removed from the pool.

* The reversible migration support now handles add_constraint with an
  options hash as the first argument.

* ASTTransformer now handles Sequel.extract, allowing Dataset#qualify
  and other uses of ASTTransformer to work with such values.

* The create_view :columns option is now suppported on SQLite 3.9.0+.

* An additional disconnect error is now recognized in the postgres
  adapter.

* A frozen string literal issue has been fixed when multiple different 
  database connection approaches have failed in the jdbc adapter.

= Backwards Compatibility

* External database adapters need to make sure that
  Database#database_error_classes returns a valid result if called
  during Database#initialize.  If you have an external adapter where
  one of the error classes depends on an argument given when
  connecting (such as the connection string), you may have to make
  some changes.
