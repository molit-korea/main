= New Features

* An mssql_optimistic_locking plugin has been added.  This is similar
  to the regular optimistic_locking plugin, but instead of using an
  integer lock column, it uses a timestamp/rowversion lock column.

* Database#create_table with the :temp=>true option on PostgreSQL now
  supports an :on_commit option.  This option can be set to :drop or
  :delete_rows to either drop or empty the temporary table on
  transaction commit.

= Other Improvements

* Dataset#insert no longer errors on PostgreSQL if the related table
  is a placeholder literal string.

* Unique constraints are now copied when emulating alter_table
  operations on SQLite.

* Clob column values are no longer returned as SQL::Blob instances
  by the db2 and ibmdb adapters unless use_clob_as_blob is true.

* SQL::Blob objects now work correctly as prepared statement
  arguments in the jdbc/db2 adapter if use_clob_as_blob is false.

= Backwards Compatibility

* The Model.primary_key array for models with composite keys is now
  frozen.

* On DB2, use_clob_as_blob now defaults to false instead of true.

* Sequel no longer uses RubyForge. The Sequel website is now located
  at http://sequel.jeremyevans.net.
