# The split filter clones an event by splitting one of its fields and
# placing each value resulting from the split into a clone of the original
# event. The field being split can either be a string or an array.
#
# An example use case of this filter is for taking output from the
# <<plugins-inputs-exec,exec input plugin>> which emits one event for
# the whole output of a command and splitting that output by newline -
# making each line an event.
#
# Split filter can also be used to split array fields in events into individual events.
# A very common pattern in JSON & XML is to make use of lists to group data together.
#
# For example, a json structure like this:
#
# [source,js]
# ----------------------------------
# { field1: ...,
#  results: [
#    { result ... },
#    { result ... },
#    { result ... },
#    ...
# ] }
# ----------------------------------
#
# The split filter can be used on the above data to create separate events for each value of `results` field
#
# [source,js]
# ----------------------------------
# filter {
#  split {
#    field => "results"
#  }
# }
# ----------------------------------
#
# The end result of each split is a complete copy of the event
# with only the current split section of the given field changed.
