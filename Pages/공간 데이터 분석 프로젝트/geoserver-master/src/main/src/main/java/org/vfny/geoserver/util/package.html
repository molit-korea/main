Manages all of the top-level responses.

<p>
Generally speaking, all of the response logic that does not tie directly to a

Response is part of the Handler/Request/Response trinity requred by
AbstractService.
</p>
Abstract Service makes use of the following workflow with Response:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This workflow can be somewhat hard to understand from the Source Code of
AbstractService - it makes use of a series of Stratagy objects to allow you to
fine tune your applications performance while maintaing the above contract
with Response.
