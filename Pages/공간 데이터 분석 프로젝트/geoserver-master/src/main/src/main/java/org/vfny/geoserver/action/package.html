  <body>
    Control of the GeoServer application (Struts Actions).
    <p>
    Struts Action subclasses, as contained in this package, opperate as the
    controller in the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
    </p>    
    <p>
    Actions used by the GeoServer Configuration system should be branched
    off of ConfigAction which provides common authentication.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the future we may wish to rethink this policy of other subsystems beside
    configuration start to make use of the STRUTS framework.
