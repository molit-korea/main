<title>GeoServer Global XML Package</title>
</head>

<body>

Offers XML based persistence to the GeoServer application.

<p>
This package is the XML Persistence Subsystem. It contains methods to read
and write the GeoServer configuration files based on the global.dto objects.
</p>

<p>
The use of Data Transfer Objects allows the XML Persistence package to not
depend on Global Method or the Dyanmic Configuration System. In fact we could
make use of this separation to back the configuration system directly onto the
xml files (without geoserver) if needed.
