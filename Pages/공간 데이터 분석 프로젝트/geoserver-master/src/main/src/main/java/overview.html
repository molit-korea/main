<p>The GeoServer Project - the open Internet gateway for geographic data</p>

<p>
The GeoServer Project is a Java (J2EE) implementation of:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The OpenGIS Consortium's  Web Feature Server specification.
With full transactional support!
</li>
<li>
The OpenGIS Consortium's Web Map Server Specification.
</li>

<li>
ZServer
</li>
</ul>

<p>
GeoServer is free software, available under the GPL 2.0 license.
</p>

</p>
Users who would like to access and modify their geographic data over the
Internet using flexible, industry-approved standards should take a look at
GeoServer.
<p>

<h3>GeoServer Design</h3>

<p>
GeoServer is constructed using a Layered Design as outlined in the diagram
below. There are two Layer systems in use - the classic J2EE
Servlet/Handler/Request/Response and the STRUTS Framework.

<h3>Use of GeoTools2</h3>
<p>
As seen in the above Layer Diagram GeoServer makes use of the wonderful
GeoTools2 library to provide data access. GeoServer maintains its own
geotools.jar available in the lib directory.  This jar is often more recent
then the latest GeoTools public beta.
</p>

Many GeoServer classes implement GeoTools2 interfaces inorder to facilitate
reuse and intergration with subsystems such as validation.
