<body>

Handles all of the request processing for GeoServer.

<p>
This package contains both the Handlers and the Request objects. Request
Objects seem to act as a Data Transfer Object between the Handlers (which
parse the client's request), and the Response (which executes their request,
and formulates a response document).
