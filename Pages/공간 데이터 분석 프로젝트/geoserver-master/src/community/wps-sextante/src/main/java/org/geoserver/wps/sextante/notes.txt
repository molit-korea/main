Elements to improve in the integration:
- have it use an embedded H2 store (a single DB? multiple DBs?) so that
  we don't end up mangling the geometry type, the attribute names and
  the like
- use the same for tables
- remove the code dealing with stores and sources, what we deal with
  GT2 wise is feature collections
- eventually get rid of the Hungarian notation?
- the raster integration still needs to be tested
