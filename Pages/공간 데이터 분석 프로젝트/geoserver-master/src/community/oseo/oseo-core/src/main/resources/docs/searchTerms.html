<h2>OpenSearch searchTerms supported syntax</h2>
The OpenSearch <tt>searchTerms</tt> parameter supports a very simple syntax:
<ul>
    <li>Terms are split by spaces, unless they are double quoted, in that case the contents of the double quote is taken as a single term</li>
    <li>The HTML description of each collection/product is searched and considered to be matching if it contains at least one search term</li>
</ul>
