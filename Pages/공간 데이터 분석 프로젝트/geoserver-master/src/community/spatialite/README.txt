SpatiaLiteOutputFormat WFS Output for GeoServer 2.2.x

USAGE
---------------------------

The SpatiaLiteOutpuFormat WFS Output adds support for one additional output format for 
WFS GetFeature requests. The new format, Spatialite is associated to the 
"application/x-sqlite3" mime type.
They produce a standard Spatialite db file.

Spatialite is a Spatial extension for Sqlite. the SpatiaLite extension enables 
SQLite to support spatial data [aka GEOMETRY], in a way conformant to OpenGis 
specifications.
SpatiaLiteOutputFormat works through a JDBC driver for Sqlite, loads the
appropriate Spatialite library and begins to execute the appropriate querys
to create the tables inside the an .sqlite file.

Request Example.
http://localhost:8080/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&version=1.0.0&typeName=topp:states&outputFormat=spatialite
 
GET requests format_options
===========================
The following format_options are supported:
