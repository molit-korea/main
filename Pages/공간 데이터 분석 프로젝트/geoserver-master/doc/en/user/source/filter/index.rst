Filtering
=========

Filtering allows selecting features that satisfy a specific set of conditions. 
Filters can be used in several contexts in GeoServer:

- in WMS requests, to select which features should be displayed on a map
- in WFS requests, to specify the features to be returned
- in SLD documents, to apply different symbolization to features on a thematic map.
