Container Considerations
========================

Java web containers such as `Tomcat <http://tomcat.apache.org>`_ or `Jetty <http://www.mortbay.org/jetty/>`_ ship with configurations that allow for fast startup, but don't always deliver the best performance.

Optimize your JVM
-----------------

Set the following performance settings in the Java virtual machine (JVM) for your container.  These settings are not specific to any container.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 40 60

   * - **Option**
     - **Description**
   * - ``-Xms128m``
     - By starting with a larger heap GeoServer will not need to pause and ask the operating system for more memory during heavy load. The setting ``-Xms128m`` will tell the virtual machine to acquire grab a 128m heap memory on initial startup.
   * - ``-Xmx756M``
     - Defines an upper limit on how much heap memory Java will request from the operating system  (use more if you have excess memory). By default, the JVM will use 1/4 of available system memory. The setting ``-Xms756m`` allocates 756MB of memory to GeoServer.
   * - ``-XX:SoftRefLRUPolicyMSPerMB=36000``
     - Increases the lifetime of "soft references" in GeoServer.  GeoServer uses soft references to cache datastore, spatial reference systems, and other data structures. By increasing this value to ``36000`` (which is 36 seconds) these values will stay in memory longer increasing the effectiveness of the cache.
   * - ``-XX:+UseParallelGC``
     - The default garbage collector up to Java 8, **pauses the application while using several threads to recover memory**. Recommended if your GeoServer will be under light load and can tolerate pauses to clean up memory.
   * - ``-XX:+UseParNewGC``
     - Enables use of the concurrent mark sweep (CMS) garbage collector **uses multiple threads to recover memory while the application is running**. Recommended for GeoServer under continuous use, with heap sizes of less than 6GB.
   * - ``â€“XX:+UseG1GC``
     - The default garbage collector since Java 9. Enables use of the `Garbage First Garbage Collector (G1) <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/tech/g1-intro-jsp-135488.html>`_ using **background threads to scan memory while the application is running** prior to cleanup. Recommended for GeoServer under continuous load and heap sizes of 6GB or more. Additionally you may experiment with ``-XX:+UseStringDeduplicationJVM`` to ask G1 to better manage common text strings in memory.

For more information about JVM configuration, see the article `Performance tuning garbage collection in Java <http://www.petefreitag.com/articles/gctuning/>`_ and `The 4 Java Garbage Collectors <http://blog.takipi.com/garbage-collectors-serial-vs-parallel-vs-cms-vs-the-g1-and-whats-new-in-java-8/>`_.

.. note::

   You can only use one garbage collector at a time. Please refrain from combining garbage collectors at runtime. 

.. note:: 
   
   If you're serving just vector data, you'll be streaming, so having more memory won't increase performance.  If you're serving coverages, however, image processing will use a tile cache and benifit from more memory. As an administrator you can configure the portion of memory available as a tile cache (see the Server Config page in the :ref:`web_admin` section) - for example to use ``0.75`` to allocate ``75%`` of the heap as a tile cache.

.. note::
   
   You can try out memory settings on the command line to check settings/defaults prior to use.
   
   To check settings use ``java -Xms128m -Xmx756m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep HeapSize``::
   
      uintx InitialHeapSize   := 134217728     {product}
      uintx MaxHeapSize       := 792723456     {product}

   Which when converted from bytes matches ``128`` MB initial heap size, and ``756`` MB max heap size.
   
   Check defaults for your hardware using ``java -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -version | grep HeapSize``::

      uintx InitialHeapSize   := 268435456     {product}
      uintx MaxHeapSize       := 4294967296    {product}
    
   The above results (from a 16 GB laptop) amount to initial heap size of 256m, and a max heap size of around 4 GB (or around 1/4 of system memory).
   
Enable the Marlin rasterizer
----------------------------

The Marlin rasterizer in Java 8 and getting better performance and scalability while rendering vector data in Java 8. 
In order to enable it add the following among the JVM startup options::

     -Xbootclasspath/a:$MARLIN_JAR 
     -Dsun.java2d.renderer=org.marlin.pisces.MarlinRenderingEngine 

where ``$MARLIN_JAR`` is the location of the ``marlin*.jar`` file located in the geoserver/WEB-INF/lib directory.

.. _production_container.enable_cors:

Enable CORS
-----------

The standalone distributions of GeoServer include the Jetty application server. Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow JavaScript applications outside of your own domain to use GeoServer.

For more information on what this does and other options see `Jetty Documentation <http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation>`_
