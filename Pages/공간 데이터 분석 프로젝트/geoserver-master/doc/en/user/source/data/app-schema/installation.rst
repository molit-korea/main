Installation
============

Application schema support is a GeoServer extension and is downloaded separately.

* Download the app-schema plugin zip file for the same version of GeoServer.
* Unzip the app-schema plugin zip file to obtain the jar files inside. Do not unzip the jar files.
* Place the jar files in the ``WEB-INF/lib`` directory of your GeoServer installation.
* Restart GeoServer to load the extension (although you might want to configure it first [see below]).
