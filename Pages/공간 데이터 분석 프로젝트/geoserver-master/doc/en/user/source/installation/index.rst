Installation
============

There are many ways to install GeoServer on your system. This section will discuss the various installation paths available.

.. note:: To run GeoServer as part of an existing servlet container such as Tomcat, please see the :ref:`installation_war` section.

.. warning:: GeoServer requires a Java 8 environment (JRE) to be installed on your system. This must be done prior to installation.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   
   win_binary
   osx_binary
   linux
   war
   upgrade

.. note:: At this time we no longer provide a Windows Installer, due to lack of a secure Windows machine where the installer can be built and signed. However if you realy need the Windows installer, you can create one following `the instruction on this site <../../developer/win-installer.html>`.
