MBStyle Styling
===============

This module adds support for the MBStyle language.

`MBStyle <https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/>`_ is a JSON based language which can be converted to SLD, the internal data model that GeoServer's renderer uses.  For details on Mapbox Style syntax see the reference below.

MBStyle is not a part of GeoServer by default, but is available as an optional install.
