     - Marks the symbolizer as an obstacle such that labels drawn via a :ref:`text symbolizer <ysld_reference_symbolizers_text>` will not be drawn over top of these features. Options are ``true`` or ``false``. Note that the bounding boxes of features are used when calculating obstacles, so unintended effects may occur when marking a line or polygon symbolizer as an obstacle.
