JSON-LD Extension
=================
This plugin brings in the ability to output features in a json-ld format, using a json-ld file as a template to operate a second level mapping over such features. 
`JSON-LD <https://json-ld.org>`_ is a Linked Data format, based on JSON format, and revolves around the concept of "context" to provide additional mappings from JSON to an RDF model.

JSON-LD extension works for both simple and complex-features.
