Community modules
=================

This section is devoted to GeoServer community modules. Community modules are considered "pending" in that they are not
officially part of the GeoServer releases. They are however built along with the
`nightly builds <https://build.geoserver.org/geoserver/>`_, so you can download and play with them.

.. warning::

   Community modules are generally considered experimental in nature and are often under constant development. For that reason documentation in this section should not be considered solid or final and will be subject to change.
