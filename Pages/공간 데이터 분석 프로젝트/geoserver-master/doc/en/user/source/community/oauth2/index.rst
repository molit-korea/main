Authentication with OAuth2
==========================

This tutorial introduces GeoServer OAuth2 support and walks through the process of
setting up authentication against an OAuth2 provider. It is recommended that the 
:ref:`security_auth_chain` section be read before proceeding.

OAuth2 Protocol and GeoServer OAuth2 core module
------------------------------------------------

This module allows GeoServer to authenticate against the `OAuth2 Protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_.

In order to let the module work, it's mandatory to setup and configure both ``oauth2`` and ``oauth2-xxxx-extension``.

The first one contains the necessary dependencies of the OAuth2 core module. This module contains the implementation of the 
GeoServer security filter, the base classes for the OAuth2 Token services and the GeoServer GUI panel.

Since in almost all cases the only thing different between OAuth2 Providers are the endpoint URIs and the client connection
information (not only the keys - public and secret - but also the user profile representations), in order to allow GeoServer
connecting to a specific OAuth2 provider it is sufficient to install the OAuth2 Core module plugin (and correctly configure
the parameters through the GeoServer GUI - see next section for the details) and the concrete implementation of the OAuth2
REST token template and resource details.

Currently this module is shipped with a sample extension for Google OAuth2 Provider. This is a particular case since the 
Google JWT response is not standard and therefore we had to define and inject also a ``GoogleUserAuthenticationConverter`` taking
the Google REST response against a valid ``access_token`` and converting it to an OAuth2 standard one.

Other than this the most interesting part is the implementation of the base class ``GeoServerOAuth2SecurityConfiguration``.

The latter contains the Google implementation of the ``OAuth2RestTemplate``.

In the next section we will see how to install and configure the OAuth2 security filter on GeoServer authenticating against 
Google OAuth2 Provider.

Configure the Google authentication provider
--------------------------------------------

The first thing to do is to configure the OAuth2 Provider and obtain ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` keys.

#. Obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials from the Google API Console.

   Visit the `Google API Console <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_ to obtain OAuth 2.0 credentials such as a client ID and client secret 
   that are known to both Google and your application. The set of values varies based on what type of application you are building. 
   For example, a JavaScript application does not require a secret, but a web server application does.
   
   * Login with a valid Google Account 
   
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console001.png
           :align: center

   * Click on ``API Manager``
   
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console002.png
           :align: center

   * Click on ``Credentials``
   
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console003.png
           :align: center
           
        .. note:: The first time you land here, Google will ask to create at least one project
        
            .. figure:: images/google_api_console004.png
               :align: center
               
            For the purpose of this tutorial we will create a sample project. You are free to create other projects or update existing ones through the `Google API Console <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_ later.
            
            .. figure:: images/google_api_console005.png
               :align: center
            
            If no ``Credentials`` are present, you will be asked to create new one.
            
            .. figure:: images/google_api_console006.png
               :align: center

#. Select an existing (or create a new one) ``OAuth Client ID``

   Click on the ``Client credentials`` context menu as shown in the figure below.
   
    .. figure:: images/google_api_console007.png
       :align: center

#. Configure a new ``Web application``

   * If it is the first time you create an ``OAuth Client ID``, you will be asked to create a new ``consent screen``
   
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console008.png
           :align: center

   * Customize the ``consent screen``
    
        .. warning:: This step is mandatory only if it's the first time you are defining a ``Web application`` on a new project.

        .. figure:: images/google_api_console009.png
           :align: center
   
        .. note:: It can be edited and updated also later (see last point of this section below)
        
   * Select ``Application type`` -> ``Web application``
   
        .. warning:: This step is mandatory only if it's the first time you are defining a ``Web application`` on a new project.

        .. figure:: images/google_api_console010.png
           :align: center
   
   * Add a ``Name`` and the ``Authorized redirect URIs`` like shown here below.
   
        .. note:: This sample creates a client working on the default local URL ``http://localhost:8080/geoserver``. Of course this will work only on a local instance and can't be used for a production system.
                  
                  However it is possible to add as many ``Authorized redirect URIs`` you need to a new ``Web application``. 
                  
                  It is also possible to create many ``Client credentials`` with customised ``consent screen`` and ``Web application``, depending on your specific needs.
                  Every public GeoServer instance (or cluster of GeoServer belonging to a specific project) should have its own specific ``Client credentials``.
       
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console011.png
           :align: center

        .. note:: Always add two entries for each URI. One without the ending ``/`` and another one with it.
       
        .. figure:: images/google_api_console012.png
           :align: center

#. Click on ``Create`` and take note of the ``Client ID`` and the ``Client Secret``.

   At the end of the procedure Google will show-up a small dialog box with the ``Client ID`` and the ``Client Secret``.
   That info can be always accessed and updated from the `Google API Console <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_
   
    .. figure:: images/google_api_console013.png
       :align: center

#. Optionally customize the ``OAuth consent screen``.

   At any time it is possible to update and customize the ``OAuth consent screen``. You can put here your logo, app name, ToS and so on.

Configure the GeoServer OAuth2 filter
-------------------------------------

#. Start GeoServer and login to the web admin interface as the ``admin`` user.
#. Click the ``Authentication`` link located under the ``Security`` section of
   the navigation sidebar.

    .. figure:: images/filter1.jpg
       :align: center

#. Scroll down to the ``Authentication Filters`` panel and click the ``Add new`` link.

    .. figure:: images/filter2.jpg
       :align: center

#. Click the ``OAuth2`` link.

    .. figure:: images/filter3.jpg
       :align: center

#. Fill in the fields of the settings form as follows:

    .. figure:: images/oauth2chain001.png
       :align: center

    The default values provided with the plugin are valid for the Google OAuth2 Provider and are the following:
    
    .. code-block:: shell

        "Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint" = False
        "Access Token URI" = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token
        "User Authorization URI" = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
        "Redirect URI" = http://localhost:8080/geoserver
        "Check Token Endpoint URL" = https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo
        "Logout URI" = https://accounts.google.com/logout
        "Scopes" = https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
    
    .. note:: 
	
	   #. ``Client ID`` and ``Client Secret`` are the ones Google provided
	   
	   #. Choose a ``Role Service`` able to recognize user emails as IDs. By default a connected user will have ``ROLE_USER`` role
       
    .. warning:: A few words on the **Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint** option
    
            This option allows you to decide whether or not to *force* automatic redirection to OAuth2 Access Token URI or not for authentication.
            
            What does that mean?
            
            * *Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint* = True
            
                If not already authenticated (or no valid **Access Token** is provided in the query string), this option will **force** a redirection to the OAuth2 Provider Login page.
                
                This may cause unwanted behavior since it will override every other explicit login method like ``form``. In other words if the filter is applied for instance to the ``web`` endpoint, it won't be possible to access to the GeoServer Admin GUI using the standard login method via browser.
                
            * *Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint* = False
            
                In order to avoid the above issue, by disabling this option you will be **forced** to use an explicit Authentication Endpoint to login via the OAuth2 Provider login page.
                
                If not already authenticated (or no valid **Access Token** is provided in the query string), you **must** authenticate through the following URLs:
                
                #. *GeoServer OAuth2 Authorization Endpoint*; ``http://<host:port>/geoserver/j_spring_oauth2_login``
                
                #. *OAuth2 Provider Explicit User Authorization Endpoint*; this must be adapted for your specific OAuth2 Provider, the protocol stated that it should be 
                
                    ::
                    
                        https://<USER_AUTHORIZATION_URI>?scope=<SCOPES>&response_type=code&redirect_uri=<REDIRECT_URI>&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>
                
                    For Google OAuth2 Provider is:
                    
                    ::
                    
                        https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?scope%3Dhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email%2Bhttps://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3D<REDIRECT_URI>%26client_id%3D<CLIENT_ID>
	
#. Update the filter chains by adding the new OAuth2 filter.

   Once everything has been configured you should be able to see the new ``oauth2`` filter available among the ``Authentication Filters`` list
   
   .. figure:: images/oauth2filter001.png
      :align: center
   
   Through this it will be always possible to modify / update the filter options, or create more of them.
   
   The next step is to add the filter to the ``Filter Chains`` you want to protect with OAuth2 also
   
   .. figure:: images/oauth2filter002.png
      :align: center

#. Select the OAuth2 Filter for each filter chain you want to protect with OAuth2.

   If you need to protect **all** the GeoServer services and the GeoServer Admin GUI too with OAuth2, you need to add the ``oauth2`` filter to all the following chains
   
   * ``web``
   
   * ``rest``
   
   * ``gwc``
   
   * ``default``
   
   The order of the authentication filters depends basically on which method you would like GeoServer to *try first*.
   
   .. note:: During the authentication process, the authentication filters of a ``Filter Chain`` are executed serially until one succeed (for more details please see the section :ref:`security_auth_chain`)
   
   .. warning:: If *Enable Redirect Authentication EntryPoint* = **True** for OAuth2 Filter, the ``web`` chain won't be able to login through the ``form`` method.
   
   .. figure:: images/oauth2filter003.png
      :align: center

   .. note:: Remember that the ``anonymous`` filter must be always the last one.

#. Save.

   .. figure:: images/oauth2filter004.png
      :align: center


It's now possible to test the authentication:

#. Navigate to the GeoServer home page and log out of the admin account. 
#. Try to login again, you should be able now to see the external Google login form.

OpenID connect authentication
-----------------------------

The OpenID connect authentication is working in a way quite similar to Google (and GitHub) 
authentications, the only difference is that the authentication page cannot propose default
values for the various endpoints, which have to be configured manually.

In case the web login will not be used, the "client ID" and "client secret" are not actually
needed, and can be filled with two made up values (the validation just checks they are present,
but they will be used only in the "authorisation flow", but not when doing OGC requests
where the client is supposed to have autonomously retrieved a valid bearer token).

.. warning:: The oauth2-openid-connect does not implement the full protocol and has been tested
   against a single server, more development and testing is needed before it can be consumed by
   a wider audience. `Pull requests <https://github.com/geoserver/geoserver/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
   to improve the module are welcomed.


SSL Trusted Certificates
------------------------

When using a custom ``Keystore`` or trying to access a non-trusted or self-signed SSL-protected OAuth2 Provider from a non-SSH connection, you will need to add the certificates to the JVM ``Keystore``.

In order to do this you can follow the next steps:

    In this example we are going to
	
	#. Retrieve SSL certificates from Google domains:
	
		"Access Token URI" = https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token therefore we need to trust ``https://accounts.google.com`` or (``accounts.google.com:443``)
		"Check Token Endpoint URL" = https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo therefore we need to trust ``https://www.googleapis.com`` or (``www.googleapis.com:443``)
		
		.. note:: You will need to get and trust certificates from every different HTTPS URL used on OAuth2 Endpoints.
	
	#. Store SSL Certificates on local hard disk

	#. Add SSL Certificates to the Java Keystore
	
	#. Enable the JVM to check for SSL Certificates from the Keystore
	
1. Retrieve the SSL Certificates from Google domains

	Use the ``openssl`` command in order to dump the certificate
	
	For ``https://accounts.google.com``
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			openssl s_client -connect accounts.google.com:443
			
		.. figure:: images/google_ssl_001.png
		   :align: center

	And for ``https://www.googleapis.com``
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			openssl s_client -connect www.googleapis.com:443
			
		.. figure:: images/google_ssl_002.png
		   :align: center

2. Store SSL Certificates on local hard disk

	Copy-and-paste the two sections ``-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-``, ``-END CERTIFICATE-`` and save them into two different ``.cert`` files
	
	.. note:: ``.cert`` file are plain text files containing the ASCII characters included on the ``-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-``, ``-END CERTIFICATE-`` sections
	
	``google.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)
	
        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_003.png
           :align: center
	
	``google-apis.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)
	
        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_004.png
           :align: center

3. Add SSL Certificates to the Java Keystore

	You can use the Java command ``keytool`` like this
	
	``google.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias google -file google.cert -keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS}

	``google-apis.cert`` (or whatever name you want with ``.cert`` extension)
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts -alias google-apis -file google-apis.cert -keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS}

    or, alternatively, you can use some graphic tool which helps you managing the SSL Certificates and Keystores, like `Portecle <http://portecle.sourceforge.net/>`_
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			java -jar c:\apps\portecle-1.9\portecle.jar
	
        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_005.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_006.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_007.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_008.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_009.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_010.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_011.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_012.png
           :align: center

        .. figure:: images/google_ssl_013.png
           :align: center

4. Enable the JVM to check for SSL Certificates from the Keystore

	In order to do this, you need to pass a ``JAVA_OPTION`` to your JVM:
	
		.. code-block:: shell
		
			-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=F:\tmp\keystore.key

5. Restart your server

.. note:: Here below you can find a bash script which simplifies the Keystore SSL Certificates importing. Use it at your convenience.

	.. code-block:: shell

		HOST=myhost.example.com
		PORT=443
		KEYSTOREFILE=dest_keystore
		KEYSTOREPASS=changeme

		# get the SSL certificate
		openssl s_client -connect ${HOST}:${PORT} </dev/null \
			| sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > ${HOST}.cert

		# create a keystore and import certificate
		keytool -import -noprompt -trustcacerts \
			-alias ${HOST} -file ${HOST}.cert \
			-keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS}

		# verify we've got it.
		keytool -list -v -keystore ${KEYSTOREFILE} -storepass ${KEYSTOREPASS} -alias ${HOST}
