GeoStyler Extension
====================
This plugin gives an extra tab in the style editor with a graphical style editor.

The `GeoStyler <https://github.com/terrestris/geostyler>`_ is a set of JavaScript packages that can be used to edit and convert various style formats.

When editing a style in the GeoStyler the SLD code editor is automatically refreshed and vice versa, so you can just edit the style and then apply/save it as usual.

If you run into trouble using the GeoStyler module or have some suggestions feel free to open an issue in the `GeoStyler repository <https://github.com/terrestris/geostyler/issues/>`_.
