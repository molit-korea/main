Bulk Operations can be done via the :api:`Metadata Rest Service <metadata.yaml>`.

The layer metadata can be exposed by the :ref:`csw` service, from there periodically harvested by
`GeoNetwork <https://geonetwork-opensource.org//>`_ . Have a look at the :ref:`tutorial_metadata` tutorial for an example of matching metadata and CSW configurations that can be harvested by GeoNetwork.
