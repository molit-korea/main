   Changing the master password

.. warning:: First thing to do as an Administrator of the System, would be to dump the Master Password generated by GeoServer, store it somewhere not accessible by anyone, and delete any ``security/masterpw.info`` or whatever file you used to dump the password in clear.

Master Password Providers
-------------------------

This section provides the options for adding, removing, and editing master password providers.

   Master password provider list

.. note:: By default the login to Admin GUI and REST APIs with Master Password is disabled. In order to enable it you will need to manually change the Master Password Provider ``config.xml``, usually located into ``security/masterpw/default/config.xml``, by adding the following statement::

    ``<loginEnabled>true</loginEnabled>``

Password policies
-----------------

This section configures the various :ref:`security_passwd_policy` available to users in GeoServer.  New password policies can be added or renamed, and existing policies edited or removed.

By default there are two password policies in effect, ``default`` and ``master``.  The ``default`` password policy, intended for most GeoServer users, does not have any active password constraints.  The ``master`` password policy, intended for the :ref:`security_root`, specifies a **minimum password length of eight characters**.  Password policies are applied to users via the user/group service.
